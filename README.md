# Selenium_Java_Page_Object_Model
POM is a design pattern which is commonly used in Selenium for Automating the Test Cases. This design pattern can be used with any kind of framework like keyword-driven, Data-driven, hybrid framework, etc. The Page object is an object-oriented class which acts as an interface for the page of your Application under test. Page class contains web elements and methods to interact with web elements. While Automating the test cases, we create the object of these Page Classes and interact with web elements by calling the methods of these classes.  -Implemented Page Object Model Framework to automate Insurance site in Selenium. -Implemented HTML Extent Reports -DataDriven in POM (Excel reading and writing) -WebDriver Instance shared in all Pages -Handling the common functions in all pages -Return type of functions -Handle common WebElement -Run the test on Jenkins
